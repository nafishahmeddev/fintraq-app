# 💎 Luno - Features & Workflows Guide

This document outlines the core features of the Luno app and the step-by-step workflows users experience, mapped directly to the local codebase architecture.

## 1. Onboarding & Initial Setup
**Feature:** A guided first-time experience to get the user ready for offline-first tracking.
**Codebase Domain:** `app/(onboarding)` and `src/features/onboarding`

**Workflow:**
1. User launches the app for the first time.
2. The app detects their device locale to automatically assign a base currency.
3. User navigates through a clean 3-step wizard (Welcome ➝ Profile ➝ Account Creation).
4. **Data Seeding:** In the background, the app uses Drizzle + SQLite to pre-populate 50+ common transaction categories (e.g., Transport, Health, Lifestyle) with predefined colors and icons.
5. User is seamlessly transitioned to the main `(main)` router stack.

## 2. Transaction Management
**Feature:** The core engine for tracking financial inputs (credits) and outputs (debits).
**Codebase Domain:** `app/transactions`, `src/features/transactions`

**Workflow:**
1. **Creation:** User taps the primary 'Add' interaction on the Dashboard.
2. User is routed to the `create.tsx` screen.
3. User toggles the **Type** (`CR` for Income, `DR` for Expense).
4. User inputs the Amount, selects the relevant Account, and assigns a Category.
5. Optional contextual metadata (Notes, custom Datetime) can be applied.
6. **Integrity Update:** On save, the `transactions` table is updated locally. A trigger hook automatically adjusts the selected account's balance to accurately reflect the change.
7. **Modification:** Users can swipe to edit/delete from the transaction list. Reversals are automatically calculated to ensure dashboard balances are perfectly restored to prior states.

## 3. Advanced Analytics & Stats
**Feature:** Deep insights into spending behavior segmented by time cohorts and currencies.
**Codebase Domain:** `app/(main)/stats.tsx`

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to the 'Stats' tab from the bottom navigation bar.
2. User selects a specific **Currency** and **Window** (7D, 30D, 90D, or ALL TIME). 
3. **Free Tier Flow:** Limited to the basic 7-day sliding window. Users see Summary tabs featuring Net Position, total Income, total Expense, and Balance. 
4. **Premium Tier Workflow:** If the free user attempts to select 30D, 90D, or ALL TIME, or triggers a locked advanced insight, the `PremiumGuard` intercepts the tap and opens the Paywall presentation.
5. **Insights Engine:** The app dynamically calculates practical metrics:
   - *Avg Daily Burn*: Standardized daily expense rate.
   - *Savings Rate*: Net Position / Income.
   - *Runway*: Balance / Avg Daily Burn.
   - *In/Out Ratio*: Income / Expense.
6. **Visual Output:** A dynamic 7-day visual cash flow trend is rendered alongside a top spend categories progress breakdown and account-weighted splits.

## 4. Monetization & Paywall 
**Feature:** Strategic feature-based gating meant to incentivize upgrading to Luno Pro.
**Codebase Domain:** `app/premium.tsx`, `src/services/iap.service.ts`, `src/components/core/PremiumGuard.tsx`

**Workflow:**
1. A user interacts with an analysis feature flagged as premium (e.g., Period Delta comparisons, long-form history).
2. The `PremiumGuard` wrapper interrupts the gesture and triggers a modal layer.
3. The user is presented with the Brutalist-themed Lifetime Paywall screen (`premium.tsx`).
4. The system communicates via `iap.service.ts` to surface the configured standard or early-adopter Lifetime tier.
5. Upon successful purchase, the local state engine (`usePremium`) triggers a global re-render, unlocking all `PremiumGuard` instances seamlessly without a restart.

## 5. Dashboard & Financial Pulse
**Feature:** The primary home hub providing at-a-glance financial health.
**Codebase Domain:** `app/(main)/index.tsx`, `src/features/dashboard`

**Workflow:**
1. Mounts the main dashboard fetching real-time balances across all created accounts.
2. Aggregates a master 'Net Position' hero unit at the very top.
3. Streams a 'Recent Transactions' live feed constrained to the most recent elements.
4. Acts as the foundational anchor giving immediate paths to settings, analytics, and new entries.

---

## 6. Personalization & Settings
**Feature:** User control over aesthetics, localization, and local data persistence.
**Codebase Domain:** `app/(main)/settings.tsx`

**Workflow:**
1. User routes to the 'Settings' tab.
2. User toggles the App Theme (Light, Dark, System Adaptive) applying to the global context instantly.
3. User accesses Data Maintenance flows if necessary (Factor Reset).
4. **Destruction Flow:** Approving a Factory Reset executes a full cascade drop across all local SQLite tables, completely erasing traces of the user's footprint for absolute privacy.
